shell
=====

shell is a mini terminal which is still a work in progress. The goal of the project is to develop a full fledged Terminal on C.

Currently, only commands without any arguments are supported.

To run the shell, first compile shell.c using a C compiler (cc or gcc). Run the shell and enjoy hacking it :)
